# Statistical-analyses-optimal-sampling-size-in-Mediterranean-forest-ecosystems
Simulated data and R code to perform the statistical analyses to identify the minimum number of pooled samples needed to obtain a reliable description of fungal communities in terms of diversity and composition in three different Mediterranean forests' stands. This is the code used in Adamo et al. to perform the statistical analyses 
that can be used in similar works. The repository was published in Zenodo (doi:10.5281/zenodo.4434407).

This project has received funding from European's Union H2020 research and innovation programme under Marie Slodowska-Curie grant agreement No 801586.
